# Suricata + Hydra Brute Force Detection Lab

This lab demonstrates how to detect a brute force attack using **Suricata IDS** and **Hydra** on a local web server.

## ðŸ”§ Lab Setup
- **OS:** Kali Linux
- **Tools:** Hydra, Suricata, Apache2
- **Target:** 127.0.0.1 (local web login)

## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed
1. Created a custom password wordlist (`passwords.txt`)
2. Ran Hydra brute force attack on `/login.php`
3. Wrote a custom Suricata rule in `local.rules`
4. Started Suricata to monitor `lo` interface
5. Captured the alert in `/var/log/suricata/fast.log`

## ðŸ“¸ Evidence
- Hydra attack results (valid passwords found)
- Suricata engine running
- Suricata alert log (`Hydra HTTP brute force attempt detected`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Showcase how SOC analysts can write detection rules for brute force attacks and verify them with real traffic.
